# FIX INSTRUCTIONS - Get Your Data Showing

## The Problem
MongoDB is connected, but you're seeing mock data instead of your seeded database articles.

## Quick Fix (2 Steps)

### Step 1: Force Reseed the Database

**Simply open this URL in your browser:**
```
http://localhost:5000/api/force-seed
```

Or use curl:
```bash
curl http://localhost:5000/api/force-seed
```

This will:
- Clear all existing data
- Reseed with 12 complete articles in the correct format

### Step 2: Refresh Your Frontend

After force-seeding, refresh your browser at `http://localhost:3000`

You should now see 12 articles from MongoDB instead of the 3 mock articles.

## Alternative: Check What's in Database

If you want to see what's currently in the database:

1. Check backend logs when you start the server
2. Look for: `[Seed] Current counts: Articles: X, Users: Y...`
3. If articles exist but are in old format, force-seed will fix it

## Verify It's Working

After force-seeding, check:

1. **Backend logs** should show:
   ```
   [ForceSeed] ✓ Created 12 articles
   [Articles] Found 12 articles from MongoDB
   [Articles] Returning 12 normalized articles
   ```

2. **Frontend** should show 12 articles with:
   - Proper titles (India's Economic Growth, Tech Innovation, etc.)
   - Proper authors (Akash Solanki, Hemant Sharma)
   - Categories as arrays
   - Excerpts
   - Read times

3. **Browser Network tab** (F12):
   - Check `/api/articles` request
   - Should return 12 articles in correct format

## If Still Not Working

1. **Check backend is running**: `http://localhost:5000/api/health`
2. **Check MongoDB connection**: Should show `"mongodb": "connected"`
3. **Check backend logs**: Look for `[Articles] Found X articles from MongoDB`
4. **Check browser console**: Look for any API errors

## Storage Error Fix

The "Access to storage" error is likely from a browser extension. To fix:
1. Disable browser extensions temporarily
2. Or ignore it (it's not blocking functionality)

**After force-seeding, your data should appear immediately!**
