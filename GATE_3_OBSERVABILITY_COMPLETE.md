# Gate 3: Observability & Confidence - Implementation Complete

**Date:** 2025-01-XX  
**Status:** ✅ **COMPLETE**  
**Objective:** Make the system observable, debuggable, and explainable in production

---

## ✅ IMPLEMENTATION SUMMARY

All Gate 3 tasks have been successfully implemented. The system now has comprehensive observability with structured logging, error tracking, performance monitoring, and request correlation.

---

## 1️⃣ STRUCTURED BACKEND LOGGING ✅

### 1.1 Structured Logger Implementation

**File:** `server/src/utils/logger.ts`

**Features:**
- ✅ JSON output in production
- ✅ Pretty-printed logs in development (pino-pretty)
- ✅ Log levels: error, warn, info, debug
- ✅ Environment-aware verbosity (debug in dev, info in prod)
- ✅ Timestamps included (ISO format)
- ✅ Automatic data sanitization (passwords, tokens, secrets redacted)
- ✅ Request context support (request ID, userId, route)

**Usage:**
```typescript
import logger, { createRequestLogger } from './utils/logger.js';

// Default logger
logger.info({ msg: 'Server started', port: 5000 });

// Request-scoped logger
const requestLogger = createRequestLogger(req.id, userId, route);
requestLogger.error({ msg: 'Operation failed', error: { message: err.message } });
```

**Console Replacement:**
- ✅ Server startup/shutdown logs use structured logger
- ✅ Global error handlers use structured logger
- ✅ Database connection logs use structured logger
- ✅ Request logging uses structured logger in production

---

## 2️⃣ REQUEST CORRELATION ✅

### 2.1 Request ID Middleware

**File:** `server/src/middleware/requestId.ts`

**Features:**
- ✅ Generates unique UUID per request
- ✅ Accepts `X-Request-Id` header from clients (for distributed tracing)
- ✅ Attaches to `req.id` for use in controllers
- ✅ Adds `X-Request-Id` to response headers
- ✅ Available in all logs via request-scoped logger

**Integration:**
- ✅ Applied globally before all routes in `server/src/index.ts`
- ✅ All error logs include request ID
- ✅ Slow request logs include request ID
- ✅ Sentry errors include request ID

---

## 3️⃣ ERROR TRACKING ✅

### 3.1 Backend Error Tracking (Sentry)

**File:** `server/src/utils/sentry.ts`

**Features:**
- ✅ Captures uncaught exceptions
- ✅ Captures unhandled promise rejections
- ✅ Captures Express errors via middleware
- ✅ Attaches context: request ID, route, userId, environment
- ✅ Sanitizes sensitive data (JWT, passwords, tokens)
- ✅ Environment-aware (disabled in dev unless `SENTRY_ENABLE_DEV=true`)
- ✅ Error deduplication handled by Sentry

**Integration:**
- ✅ Initialized early in `server/src/index.ts` (before routes)
- ✅ Express error handler middleware applied
- ✅ Global exception handlers capture errors
- ✅ Graceful shutdown flushes Sentry events

**Environment Variables:**
- `SENTRY_DSN` - Sentry project DSN (optional)
- `SENTRY_ENABLE_DEV` - Enable in development (default: false)

### 3.2 Frontend Error Tracking (Sentry)

**File:** `src/utils/sentry.ts`

**Features:**
- ✅ Captures runtime errors
- ✅ Captures React error boundaries (via telemetry integration)
- ✅ Captures failed API calls (5xx errors)
- ✅ Attaches route and user context
- ✅ Sanitizes user-identifiable data
- ✅ Browser replay support (masked for privacy)
- ✅ Performance tracing (10% sample in prod, 100% in dev)

**Integration:**
- ✅ Initialized in `src/main.tsx` (before React render)
- ✅ Error boundaries automatically report via `telemetry.ts`
- ✅ API client captures network and server errors
- ✅ Request ID correlation from response headers

**Environment Variables:**
- `VITE_SENTRY_DSN` - Sentry project DSN (optional)
- `VITE_SENTRY_ENABLE_DEV` - Enable in development (default: false)

---

## 4️⃣ SLOW REQUEST & PERFORMANCE VISIBILITY ✅

### 4.1 Slow Request Detection

**File:** `server/src/middleware/slowRequest.ts`

**Features:**
- ✅ Measures request duration
- ✅ Logs requests exceeding 1000ms threshold
- ✅ Includes: method, route, status, duration, request ID
- ✅ Non-blocking (only observes, doesn't affect requests)

**Integration:**
- ✅ Applied globally before routes
- ✅ Works with all HTTP methods
- ✅ Logs to structured logger with warning level

### 4.2 Database Performance Signals

**File:** `server/src/utils/db.ts`

**Features:**
- ✅ Mongoose plugin hooks into all queries
- ✅ Logs queries exceeding 500ms threshold
- ✅ Includes: collection name, operation type, duration
- ✅ Lightweight (no query payload logging)
- ✅ Works with: find, findOne, findOneAndUpdate, aggregate, etc.

**Integration:**
- ✅ Automatically applied to all Mongoose models
- ✅ Logs to structured logger with warning level
- ✅ No performance overhead (only measures time)

---

## 5️⃣ FRONTEND VISIBILITY ✅

### 5.1 Error Boundaries by Domain

**Implementation:**
- ✅ **Top-level boundary:** Wraps entire app (`src/App.tsx`)
- ✅ **Admin routes:** Wrapped in `AdminPanelPage`
- ✅ **Auth flows:** Wrapped around verify-email and reset-password routes
- ✅ **Feed/content areas:** Wrapped around HomePage, CollectionsPage, CollectionDetailPage

**Features:**
- ✅ User-safe fallback UI
- ✅ Automatic error reporting to Sentry
- ✅ "Try Again" button for recovery
- ✅ Development-only error details

**File:** `src/components/UI/ErrorBoundary.tsx`

### 5.2 Network Error Visibility

**File:** `src/services/apiClient.ts`

**Features:**
- ✅ Failed API calls logged once (no duplicates)
- ✅ Errors include: endpoint, status, request ID
- ✅ Network errors (connection refused, timeout) captured
- ✅ Server errors (5xx) automatically sent to Sentry
- ✅ Request ID extracted from `X-Request-Id` response header

**Integration:**
- ✅ Telemetry integration for slow API calls
- ✅ Sentry integration for error tracking
- ✅ Request ID correlation for debugging

---

## 6️⃣ PRODUCTION SAFETY NETS ✅

### 6.1 Fatal Error Handling

**Implementation:** `server/src/index.ts`

**Features:**
- ✅ Process-level handlers for `uncaughtException`
- ✅ Process-level handlers for `unhandledRejection`
- ✅ Errors logged with full context before exit
- ✅ Sentry events flushed before process exit (2s timeout)
- ✅ Clean server shutdown on fatal errors
- ✅ Production: exits after logging
- ✅ Development: logs but continues (for debugging)

### 6.2 Environment-Aware Behavior

**Backend:**
- ✅ Verbose logging in development (debug level)
- ✅ Reduced noise in production (info level)
- ✅ Sentry disabled in dev (unless explicitly enabled)
- ✅ Pretty-printed logs in dev, JSON in prod

**Frontend:**
- ✅ Sentry disabled in dev (unless explicitly enabled)
- ✅ 100% trace sampling in dev, 10% in prod
- ✅ Error details shown in dev, generic messages in prod
