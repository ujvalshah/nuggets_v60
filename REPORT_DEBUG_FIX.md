# Report Visibility Debug Fix

## Issue
Reports still not showing in Moderation Queue despite fixes.

## Additional Fixes Applied

### 1. Added Console Logging ✅
**Files**:
- `src/admin/pages/AdminModerationPage.tsx` - Added logging in `loadData()`
- `src/admin/services/adminModerationService.ts` - Added logging in `listReports()`

**Purpose**: To debug what's happening in the API calls and data flow.

### 2. Ensure Filter Always Set ✅
**File**: `src/admin/pages/AdminModerationPage.tsx`
- **Change**: Initialize filter to 'open' if URL param is missing
- **Line**: 48-56
- **Impact**: Filter is always explicitly set to 'open' on initial load

### 3. Explicit Filter in loadData ✅
**File**: `src/admin/pages/AdminModerationPage.tsx`
- **Change**: `const activeFilter = filter || 'open'` to ensure filter is never undefined
- **Line**: 72
- **Impact**: Always uses 'open' as fallback

## Debugging Steps

1. **Check Browser Console**:
   - Look for `[AdminModeration]` logs
   - Check `[AdminModerationService]` logs
   - Verify endpoint being called
   - Check response data

2. **Check Server Logs**:
   - Look for `[Moderation]` logs
   - Verify query being executed
   - Check if reports are found

3. **Verify Database**:
   - Check if reports exist with `status: 'open'`
   - Verify reports are not filtered out

## Next Steps

1. Open browser console
2. Navigate to Moderation Queue
3. Check console logs for:
   - Endpoint being called
   - Response received
   - Reports count
4. Check server logs for:
   - Query executed
   - Reports found
5. If still no reports, verify:
   - Reports exist in DB with `status: 'open'`
   - Authentication is working
   - API endpoint is correct

## Files Modified

1. `src/admin/pages/AdminModerationPage.tsx`
   - Added console logging
   - Ensure filter defaults to 'open'
   - Explicit filter in loadData

2. `src/admin/services/adminModerationService.ts`
   - Added console logging at each step
   - Log endpoint, response, and mapped reports
