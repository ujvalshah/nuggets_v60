# QUICK FIX - Restore Your Data Visibility

## Immediate Solution

Your `.env` file is set to use the backend (`VITE_ADAPTER_TYPE=rest`), but the backend might not be running or connected.

### Quick Fix Option 1: Switch to Local Adapter (See Data Immediately)

1. Open `.env` file in project root
2. Find this line:
   ```
   VITE_ADAPTER_TYPE=rest
   ```
3. Change it to:
   ```
   VITE_ADAPTER_TYPE=local
   ```
4. Save the file
5. **Restart your frontend** (stop and run `npm run dev` again)
6. You should now see mock data (4 articles)

### Quick Fix Option 2: Start Backend Properly

1. **Terminal 1 - Start Backend:**
   ```bash
   npm run dev:server
   ```
   Wait for: `[Server] ✓ Express server listening on http://0.0.0.0:5000`

2. **Terminal 2 - Start Frontend:**
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

3. **Check Browser Console (F12):**
   - Look for `[AdapterFactory] ✅ Using RestAdapter`
   - Check for any red errors
   - Check Network tab for API calls

4. **Verify Backend:**
   - Open: http://localhost:5000/api/health
   - Should show: `{"status":"ok","mongodb":"connected"}` or `"disconnected"`

## Why Your Data Disappeared

When using `VITE_ADAPTER_TYPE=rest`:
- Frontend tries to fetch from backend API
- If backend not running → No data
- If backend running but MongoDB not connected → Uses in-memory fallback (4 articles)
- If MongoDB connected but empty → Needs seeding (12 articles after seed)

## About "The Mine" Page

The "Mine" page is at:
- URL: `/myspace` or `/profile/{your-user-id}`
- Component: `MySpacePage`
- It shows your nuggets, collections, folders, bookmarks

If you can't see it:
1. Make sure you're logged in (check Header for user menu)
2. Navigate to `/myspace` or click "My Space" in header
3. If using rest adapter, backend must be running

## About Utility Layout

The utility layout includes:
- Sidebar with categories/topics
- Collections widget
- Footer links

These should appear automatically on the homepage. If not visible:
1. Check if you're in "feed" view mode (not "grid")
2. Check browser console for errors
3. Verify data is loading (Network tab)

## Next Steps

1. **Choose your adapter:**
   - `local` = Mock data, no backend needed (fastest)
   - `rest` = Real backend, requires server running

2. **If using `rest`:**
   - Always start backend first: `npm run dev:server`
   - Then start frontend: `npm run dev`
   - Check MongoDB connection in backend logs

3. **If data still missing:**
   - Check browser console (F12) for errors
   - Check Network tab for failed API calls
   - Verify backend health: http://localhost:5000/api/health

## Your Current Setup

Based on your `.env`:
- ✅ Using RestAdapter (backend API)
- ✅ MongoDB URI configured (Atlas)
- ⚠️ Need to ensure backend is running
- ⚠️ Need to ensure MongoDB is connected

## Recommendation

For immediate visibility:
1. **Temporarily switch to local adapter** (see Option 1 above)
2. Verify all pages work
3. Then switch back to `rest` and ensure backend is running
