# Fixes Applied

## Package.json Location

**Your package.json is correctly located in the root folder.** This is the standard structure for a monorepo-style project where:

- **Root `/package.json`** - Contains shared dependencies for both frontend and backend
- **Frontend** (`/src`) - React/Vite application  
- **Backend** (`/server/src`) - Express API server

Both frontend and backend share the same `node_modules` folder, which is more efficient than having separate package.json files.

If you need separate package management, you could move it, but the current setup is correct and recommended.

## Missing Files Created

Several files were missing that prevented the server from starting. I've created:

1. `src/hooks/useAuth.ts` - Auth hook wrapper
2. `src/services/storageService.ts` - Storage service adapter
3. `src/services/adapterFactory.ts` - Adapter factory
4. Fixed import paths for `adminConfigService`

## Still Need to Create

The following files still need to be created (referenced in COMPLETE_CODEBASE.txt):
- `src/components/Header.tsx` - Main header component
- `src/services/adapters/IAdapter.ts` - Adapter interface
- `src/services/adapters/LocalAdapter.ts` - Local storage adapter
- `src/services/adapters/RestAdapter.ts` - REST API adapter
- `src/components/UI/*` - UI components (Input, Toast, Badge, etc.)
- `src/context/ToastContext.tsx` - Toast context
- `src/hooks/useToast.ts` - Toast hook
