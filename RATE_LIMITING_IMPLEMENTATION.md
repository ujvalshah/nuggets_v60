# 🔒 Rate Limiting Implementation - Authentication Endpoints

**Date:** 2025-01-XX  
**Status:** ✅ **COMPLETE**

---

## 📋 SUMMARY

Rate limiting has been successfully implemented for authentication endpoints to prevent brute force attacks and abuse.

---

## ✅ IMPLEMENTATION DETAILS

### 1. Package Installation

**Package:** `express-rate-limit`  
**Status:** ✅ Installed  
**Location:** Root `package.json`

```bash
npm install express-rate-limit
```

---

### 2. Rate Limiting Middleware

**File:** `server/src/middleware/rateLimiter.ts`

#### Login Rate Limiter
- **Limit:** 5 requests per 15 minutes per IP
- **Window:** 15 minutes (900,000 ms)
- **Purpose:** Stricter limit to prevent brute force attacks on login
- **Response:** HTTP 429 with message: `"Too many attempts. Please try again later."`

#### Signup Rate Limiter
- **Limit:** 10 requests per hour per IP
- **Window:** 1 hour (3,600,000 ms)
- **Purpose:** Moderate limit to prevent abuse while allowing legitimate signups
- **Response:** HTTP 429 with message: `"Too many attempts. Please try again later."`

**Features:**
- ✅ Standard headers enabled (`RateLimit-*` headers)
- ✅ Legacy headers disabled (`X-RateLimit-*` headers)
- ✅ Custom handler for consistent error response format
- ✅ IP-based limiting (automatic via express-rate-limit)

---

### 3. Route Integration

**File:** `server/src/routes/auth.ts`

**Changes:**
```typescript
// Before
router.post('/login', authController.login);
router.post('/signup', authController.signup);

// After
router.post('/login', loginLimiter, authController.login);
router.post('/signup', signupLimiter, authController.signup);
```

**Applied To:**
- ✅ `POST /api/auth/login` - Login endpoint
- ✅ `POST /api/auth/signup` - Signup endpoint
- ❌ `GET /api/auth/me` - Not rate limited (protected route, requires auth)

---

## 🔒 SECURITY FEATURES

### Rate Limit Configuration

| Endpoint | Limit | Window | Rationale |
|----------|-------|--------|-----------|
| **Login** | 5 requests | 15 minutes | Stricter to prevent brute force attacks |
| **Signup** | 10 requests | 1 hour | Moderate to prevent abuse while allowing legitimate signups |

### Error Response

**HTTP Status:** `429 Too Many Requests`

**Response Body:**
```json
{
  "message": "Too many attempts. Please try again later."
}
```

**Headers:**
- `RateLimit-Limit`: Maximum number of requests allowed
- `RateLimit-Remaining`: Number of requests remaining in current window
- `RateLimit-Reset`: Time when the rate limit resets (Unix timestamp)

---

## ✅ SAFETY CHECKS

### ✅ Non-Blocking for Valid Users
- **Login:** 5 attempts per 15 minutes is reasonable for legitimate users
- **Signup:** 10 attempts per hour allows for legitimate signup attempts
- Limits are per IP, so shared networks may affect multiple users (acceptable trade-off)

### ✅ No Internal Details Exposed
- Generic error message: `"Too many attempts. Please try again later."`
- No stack traces or internal error details
- Standard HTTP 429 status code

### ✅ Development & Production Ready
- Works in both development and production environments
- No environment-specific configuration needed
- IP-based limiting works automatically

---

## 📊 VERIFICATION

### Files Modified

1. ✅ `server/src/middleware/rateLimiter.ts` (created)
   - Login rate limiter
   - Signup rate limiter

2. ✅ `server/src/routes/auth.ts` (updated)
   - Added rate limiting middleware to login route
   - Added rate limiting middleware to signup route

3. ✅ `package.json` (updated)
   - Added `express-rate-limit` dependency

### Linter Status
✅ No linter errors

### Breaking Changes
❌ **NONE** - Rate limiting is additive, no existing functionality changed

---

## 🧪 TESTING RECOMMENDATIONS

### Manual Testing

1. **Login Rate Limit:**
   - Make 5 login requests from same IP within 15 minutes
   - 6th request should return HTTP 429
   - Wait 15 minutes, should be able to make requests again

2. **Signup Rate Limit:**
   - Make 10 signup requests from same IP within 1 hour
   - 11th request should return HTTP 429
   - Wait 1 hour, should be able to make requests again

3. **Different IPs:**
   - Rate limits are per IP
   - Different IPs should have independent limits

4. **Other Endpoints:**
   - Verify `/api/auth/me` is not rate limited
   - Verify other API endpoints are not rate limited

---

## 📝 NOTES

### Design Decisions

1. **IP-Based Limiting:**
   - Simple and effective
   - Works automatically with express-rate-limit
   - Trade-off: Shared networks (offices, schools) share limits

2. **Different Limits for Login vs Signup:**
   - Login: Stricter (5/15min) - more sensitive to brute force
   - Signup: Moderate (10/hour) - allows legitimate signups

3. **Generic Error Messages:**
   - Security best practice
   - Doesn't reveal rate limit details to attackers
   - User-friendly message

4. **Standard Headers:**
   - Uses `RateLimit-*` headers (RFC 7231 compliant)
   - Disables legacy `X-RateLimit-*` headers

### Future Enhancements (Not Implemented)

- Account-based rate limiting (after login)
- CAPTCHA integration (for repeated failures)
- Account lockout (after X failed attempts)
- Rate limit bypass for trusted IPs
- Redis-based rate limiting (for distributed systems)

---

## ✅ IMPLEMENTATION COMPLETE

**Status:** ✅ **READY FOR PRODUCTION**

**Next Steps:**
1. Test rate limiting in development
2. Monitor rate limit hits in production
3. Adjust limits if needed based on usage patterns
4. Consider account-based rate limiting for additional security
