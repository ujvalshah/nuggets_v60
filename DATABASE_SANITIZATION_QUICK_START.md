# Database Sanitization - Quick Start Guide

## 🚀 Quick Commands

### 1. Run Discovery (Safe - No Data Modified)
```bash
npm run sanitize:dry-run
```

### 2. Execute Cleanup (Requires Confirmation)
```bash
FORCE_EXECUTE=true DRY_RUN=false npm run sanitize:execute
```

## 📋 What It Does

### ✅ Automatically Cleans (Safe Auto-Fix)
- Orphaned collection entries (non-existent articles/users)
- Orphaned collection followers
- Orphaned bookmarks
- Orphaned bookmark folders
- Orphaned bookmark folder links

### ⚠️ Requires Manual Review
- Collections with orphaned creators
- Articles with orphaned authors
- Reports (preserved for audit trail)
- Moderation audit logs (preserved for compliance)
- Feedback entries (may preserve for history)

### 🚫 Never Touches
