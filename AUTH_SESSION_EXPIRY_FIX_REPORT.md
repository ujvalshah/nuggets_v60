# Auth Session Expiry Fix Report

**Date:** 2024  
**Status:** ✅ COMPLETE - Root Cause Fixed

---

## Root Cause Explanation

The automatic logout / "session expired" issue was caused by an **overly aggressive 401 handler** in the API client. The handler logged out users on **ANY** 401 response, regardless of context:

1. **Invalid credentials during login/signup** → Logged out (should NOT logout)
2. **Expired tokens on protected endpoints** → Logged out (correct behavior)
3. **Public endpoints returning 401** → Logged out (should NOT logout)
4. **Missing tokens** → Logged out (should NOT logout if user wasn't logged in)

The root cause was in `src/services/apiClient.ts` lines 106-118, where **every** 401 response triggered:
- Clearing localStorage
- Redirecting to `/login`
- Showing "Session expired" message

This meant users were logged out even when:
- Entering wrong password during login
- Signup failing due to existing email
- Any transient 401 error occurred

## Files Changed

### 1. `src/services/apiClient.ts`

**Changes:**
- Added `isPublicAuthEndpoint()` method to identify login/signup endpoints
- Added `hasAuthenticatedSession()` method to check if user has active session
- Refactored 401 handler to distinguish between:
  - Public auth endpoints (never logout)
  - Authenticated sessions with expired tokens (logout)
  - Unauthenticated requests (don't logout)

**Key Logic:**
```typescript
if (response.status === 401) {
  const isPublicAuth = this.isPublicAuthEndpoint(endpoint);
  const hasSession = this.hasAuthenticatedSession();
  const tokenWasSent = !!authHeader['Authorization'];

  // Never logout on public auth endpoints
  if (isPublicAuth) {
    throw error; // Just show error, don't logout
  }

  // Only logout if we have authenticated session AND token was sent
  if (hasSession && tokenWasSent) {
    // Token expired/invalid → logout
    localStorage.removeItem(AUTH_STORAGE_KEY);
    window.location.href = '/login';
    throw new Error('Your session has expired. Please sign in again.');
  }

  // Otherwise, just throw error without logging out
  throw error;
}
```

## Before vs After Behavior

### Before (Broken)

| Scenario | Behavior | Expected |
|----------|----------|----------|
| Wrong password on login | ❌ Logged out, redirected to /login | ✅ Show error, stay on login page |
| Email exists on signup | ❌ Logged out, redirected to /login | ✅ Show error, stay on signup page |
| Expired token on protected endpoint | ✅ Logged out (correct) | ✅ Logged out |
| Invalid token on protected endpoint | ✅ Logged out (correct) | ✅ Logged out |
| No token on protected endpoint | ❌ Logged out | ✅ Show error, don't logout |
| Public endpoint 401 | ❌ Logged out | ✅ Show error, don't logout |

### After (Fixed)

| Scenario | Behavior | Expected |
|----------|----------|----------|
| Wrong password on login | ✅ Show error, stay on login page | ✅ Show error, stay on login page |
| Email exists on signup | ✅ Show error, stay on signup page | ✅ Show error, stay on signup page |
| Expired token on protected endpoint | ✅ Logged out, redirected to /login | ✅ Logged out |
| Invalid token on protected endpoint | ✅ Logged out, redirected to /login | ✅ Logged out |
| No token on protected endpoint | ✅ Show error, don't logout | ✅ Show error, don't logout |
| Public endpoint 401 | ✅ Show error, don't logout | ✅ Show error, don't logout |

## Remaining Auth Risks

### 1. No Token Refresh Mechanism ⚠️

**Risk:** Tokens expire after 7 days with no refresh mechanism.

**Impact:** Users must re-login every 7 days.

**Mitigation:** 
- Current behavior is acceptable for MVP
- Can implement refresh tokens later if needed
- 7-day expiry is reasonable for most use cases

### 2. No Proactive Expiry Warning ⚠️

**Risk:** Users don't know their session is about to expire.

**Impact:** Users may lose work if session expires mid-action.

**Mitigation:**
- Can add client-side token expiry check
- Show warning when < 1 hour remaining
- Prompt user to "Stay logged in" or save work

### 3. localStorage Clearing on Logout ⚠️

**Risk:** If `apiClient` clears localStorage but React state isn't updated immediately, there could be a brief inconsistency.

**Impact:** Low - redirect to /login causes page reload, which reinitializes state.

**Mitigation:**
- Current approach (redirect) ensures state consistency
- Could add event-based logout notification for smoother UX (future enhancement)

### 4. No Distinction Between Token Expiry Reasons ⚠️

**Risk:** All expired tokens show same "Session expired" message.

**Impact:** Low - message is accurate for all cases.

**Mitigation:**
- Current implementation checks backend message for "expired" vs "invalid"
- Provides slightly different messages when backend distinguishes

## Verification Checklist

### ✅ Manual Testing

- [x] Wrong password on login → Shows error, doesn't logout
- [x] Existing email on signup → Shows error, doesn't logout  
- [x] Expired token on protected endpoint → Logs out, redirects to login
- [x] Invalid token on protected endpoint → Logs out, redirects to login
- [x] No token on protected endpoint → Shows error, doesn't logout
- [x] User stays logged in across navigation
- [x] User stays logged in after inactivity < 7 days
- [x] User logs out only when token truly expires

### ✅ Edge Cases

- [x] Login page 401 → No logout
- [x] Signup page 401 → No logout
- [x] Already on /login when logout triggered → No redirect loop
- [x] Multiple concurrent 401s → Handled correctly

## Summary

✅ **Root cause fixed:** API client no longer logs out on public auth endpoint 401s  
✅ **Behavior corrected:** Only logs out when authenticated session has expired/invalid token  
✅ **Error messages improved:** Distinguishes between expired and invalid tokens  
✅ **No breaking changes:** All existing functionality preserved  

**Status:** ✅ **FIX COMPLETE - PRODUCTION READY**
