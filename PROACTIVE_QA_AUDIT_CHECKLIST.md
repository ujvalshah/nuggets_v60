# Proactive QA/QC Audit Checklist

**Purpose:** Prevent common bugs before they reach production through systematic code review and development practices.

**When to Use:**
- Before committing new features
- During code reviews
- Before merging PRs
- During refactoring
- When adding new async operations

---

## 🚨 Critical Patterns to Audit

### 1. Component Lifecycle & State Updates

#### ✅ Checklist:
- [ ] **State updates after unmount**: All async operations check `isMounted` before `setState`
- [ ] **useEffect cleanup**: Every `useEffect` with async operations has cleanup function
- [ ] **Memory leaks**: Event listeners, timers, subscriptions are cleaned up
- [ ] **Race conditions**: Multiple rapid state updates are handled correctly

#### 🔍 Pattern to Look For:
```typescript
// ❌ BAD - State update after unmount
const loadData = async () => {
  const data = await fetchData();
  setData(data); // Could crash if component unmounted
};

// ✅ GOOD - Protected state update
const loadData = async (isMounted: { current: boolean }) => {
  const data = await fetchData();
  if (isMounted.current) {
    setData(data);
  }
};
```

#### 📋 Audit Questions:
1. Does every async operation check mount status before updating state?
2. Are all `useEffect` hooks properly cleaned up?
3. Are event listeners removed in cleanup?
4. Are timers/intervals cleared?

---

### 2. Async Operations & Error Handling

#### ✅ Checklist:
- [ ] **Request cancellation**: Cancelled requests are handled gracefully
- [ ] **Error boundaries**: Critical errors don't crash entire app
- [ ] **Loading states**: UI shows loading state during async operations
- [ ] **Error messages**: Users see helpful error messages
- [ ] **Retry logic**: Failed operations can be retried
- [ ] **Timeout handling**: Long-running operations have timeouts

#### 🔍 Pattern to Look For:
```typescript
// ❌ BAD - Unhandled cancellation
try {
  const data = await apiClient.get('/data');
  setData(data);
} catch (e) {
  toast.error("Failed"); // Shows error even for cancellations
}

// ✅ GOOD - Handled cancellation
try {
  const data = await apiClient.get('/data');
  if (isMounted.current) setData(data);
} catch (e: any) {
  if (e?.message === 'Request cancelled') return; // Silent ignore
  if (isMounted.current) toast.error("Failed");
}
```

#### 📋 Audit Questions:
1. Are cancelled requests handled silently?
2. Do error handlers check mount status before showing toasts?
3. Are network errors differentiated from validation errors?
4. Are async operations wrapped in try-catch?

---

### 3. Navigation & Route Changes

#### ✅ Checklist:
- [ ] **Navigation guards**: Prevent navigation during critical operations
- [ ] **Route params validation**: URL params are validated before use
- [ ] **Redirect handling**: Redirects don't cause infinite loops
- [ ] **Deep linking**: Direct URLs work correctly
- [ ] **Back button**: Browser back button works as expected
- [ ] **State preservation**: Important state is preserved during navigation

#### 🔍 Pattern to Look For:
```typescript
// ❌ BAD - Navigation during processing
<button onClick={() => navigate('/home')}>
  Go Back
</button>

// ✅ GOOD - Guarded navigation
<button 
  onClick={() => {
    if (isProcessing) {
      toast.error("Please wait");
      return;
    }
    navigate('/home');
  }}
>
  Go Back
</button>
```

#### 📋 Audit Questions:
1. Can users navigate away during critical operations?
2. Are route params validated before use?
3. Do redirects handle missing data gracefully?
4. Is navigation state cleaned up properly?

---

### 4. Array & Object Safety

#### ✅ Checklist:
- [ ] **Null/undefined checks**: Arrays/objects checked before calling methods
- [ ] **Default values**: Arrays default to `[]`, objects to `{}`
- [ ] **Type guards**: Runtime checks for expected types
- [ ] **Optional chaining**: Used for nested property access
- [ ] **Array methods**: `.filter()`, `.map()`, etc. only called on arrays

#### 🔍 Pattern to Look For:
```typescript
// ❌ BAD - No null check
const items = articles.filter(a => a.visible);

// ✅ GOOD - Defensive check
const safeArticles = Array.isArray(articles) ? articles : [];
const items = safeArticles.filter(a => a.visible);
```

#### 📋 Audit Questions:
1. Are arrays validated before calling `.filter()`, `.map()`, etc.?
2. Are API responses validated before use?
3. Are default values provided for optional data?
4. Is optional chaining used for nested properties?

---

### 5. Form Handling & Validation

#### ✅ Checklist:
- [ ] **Input validation**: All inputs validated before submission
- [ ] **Disabled states**: Buttons disabled during submission
- [ ] **Form reset**: Forms reset after successful submission
- [ ] **Error display**: Validation errors shown to users
- [ ] **Loading states**: Forms show loading during submission
- [ ] **Duplicate prevention**: Prevents double-submission

#### 🔍 Pattern to Look For:
```typescript
// ❌ BAD - No validation, can submit multiple times
const handleSubmit = async () => {
  await createArticle(data);
};

// ✅ GOOD - Validated, protected
const handleSubmit = async () => {
  if (isSubmitting || !isValid) return;
  setIsSubmitting(true);
  try {
    await createArticle(data);
    resetForm();
  } finally {
    setIsSubmitting(false);
  }
};
```

#### 📋 Audit Questions:
1. Are forms validated before submission?
2. Are submit buttons disabled during processing?
3. Are forms reset after successful submission?
4. Is double-submission prevented?

---

### 6. API Integration & Data Fetching

#### ✅ Checklist:
- [ ] **Request cancellation**: Previous requests cancelled when new ones start
- [ ] **Error handling**: Network errors handled gracefully
- [ ] **Loading states**: UI shows loading during fetches
- [ ] **Empty states**: Empty data handled gracefully
- [ ] **Pagination**: Large datasets paginated correctly
- [ ] **Cache invalidation**: Stale data refreshed appropriately

#### 🔍 Pattern to Look For:
```typescript
// ❌ BAD - No cancellation, race conditions
const loadData = async () => {
  const data = await apiClient.get('/data');
  setData(data);
};

// ✅ GOOD - Cancellation key, mount check
const loadData = async (isMounted: { current: boolean }) => {
  try {
    const data = await apiClient.get('/data', undefined, 'loadData');
    if (isMounted.current) setData(data);
  } catch (e: any) {
    if (e?.message === 'Request cancelled') return;
    if (isMounted.current) handleError(e);
  }
};
```

#### 📋 Audit Questions:
1. Are duplicate requests cancelled?
2. Are API errors handled with user-friendly messages?
3. Are loading states shown during fetches?
4. Is empty data handled gracefully?

---

### 7. Type Safety & Runtime Validation

#### ✅ Checklist:
- [ ] **TypeScript types**: All functions have proper types
- [ ] **Runtime validation**: API responses validated at runtime
- [ ] **Type guards**: Type narrowing used where needed
- [ ] **Optional types**: Optional properties handled correctly
- [ ] **Union types**: Union types handled exhaustively

#### 🔍 Pattern to Look For:
```typescript
// ❌ BAD - No runtime validation
const processData = (data: any) => {
  return data.items.map(i => i.name);
};

// ✅ GOOD - Runtime validation
const processData = (data: unknown) => {
  if (!data || typeof data !== 'object') return [];
  if (!('items' in data) || !Array.isArray(data.items)) return [];
  return data.items
    .filter((i): i is { name: string } => typeof i === 'object' && 'name' in i)
    .map(i => i.name);
};
```

#### 📋 Audit Questions:
1. Are API responses validated at runtime?
2. Are TypeScript types accurate?
3. Are type guards used for type narrowing?
4. Are optional properties handled safely?

## 📝 Common Bug Patterns & Solutions

### Pattern 1: State Update After Unmount
**Symptom:** Console warnings, crashes
**Solution:** Use `isMountedRef` pattern

### Pattern 2: Array Method on Non-Array
**Symptom:** `TypeError: X.filter is not a function`
**Solution:** Always validate arrays before use

### Pattern 3: Unhandled Promise Rejection
**Symptom:** Uncaught promise errors in console
**Solution:** Handle cancellations and errors

### Pattern 4: Memory Leak

## 🎯 Quick Reference: Red Flags

Watch out for these patterns:

- ❌ `setState()` in async without mount check
- ❌ `.filter()` without array validation
- ❌ `navigate()` without guards
- ❌ `await` without try-catch
