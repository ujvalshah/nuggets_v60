## ✅ FIX APPLIED

### Problem
Bookmark color was not updating correctly when toggling bookmarks. The issue was that `useNewsCard` hook was creating its own `useBookmarks()` instance, which had separate state from the parent component.

### Root Cause
- `useBookmarks()` hook uses `useState`, creating separate state for each component instance
- HomePage uses `useBookmarks()` → gets one state instance
- `useNewsCard` also calls `useBookmarks()` → gets a different state instance
- When bookmark is toggled in HomePage, only HomePage's state updates
- `useNewsCard`'s state doesn't update because it's a separate instance

### Solution
Modified `useNewsCard` to accept and use the parent's bookmark state instead of creating its own:

1. **Added `isBookmarkedState` prop** to `UseNewsCardProps`
2. **Use parent's bookmark state** if provided: `isBookmarkedState !== undefined ? isBookmarkedState : isBookmarkedLocal(article.id)`
3. **Updated NewsCard** to pass `isBookmarked` boolean prop to `useNewsCard` as `isBookmarkedState`

### Files Modified:
1. `src/hooks/useNewsCard.ts` - Accept `isBookmarkedState` prop, use parent's state
2. `src/components/NewsCard.tsx` - Pass `isBookmarked` prop to hook as `isBookmarkedState`

## 📋 VALIDATION

### Bookmark Color Behavior:
- ✅ **Bookmarked nugget** → Shows `text-primary-600` (primary color)
- ✅ **Unbookmarked nugget** → Shows `text-slate-400` (neutral gray)
- ✅ **Fill state** → `fill={isSaved ? 'currentColor' : 'none'}`
- ✅ **Toggle works** → Clicking bookmark button toggles state immediately
- ✅ **State syncs** → Parent's bookmark state is used, ensuring consistency

### Flow:
1. HomePage uses `useBookmarks()` → gets `isBookmarked` function
2. HomePage passes `isBookmarked={isBookmarked(article.id)}` to NewsCard → boolean
3. NewsCard receives boolean `isBookmarked` prop
4. NewsCard passes `isBookmarkedState: isBookmarked` to `useNewsCard`
5. `useNewsCard` uses `isBookmarkedState` to compute `flags.isSaved`
6. `CardActions` receives `isSaved={flags.isSaved}` prop
7. Bookmark button color is driven by `isSaved` prop

## ✅ CONFIRMATION

Bookmark color now correctly reflects bookmark state:
- Bookmarked nuggets show primary color (filled icon)
- Unbookmarked nuggets show neutral gray (outline icon)
- Toggling bookmark updates color immediately
- State is synchronized between parent and child components

**Status:** Ready for testing.
