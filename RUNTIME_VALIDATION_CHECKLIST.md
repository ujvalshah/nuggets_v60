   - Some endpoints may fail with 401 if token is missing

2. **Performance**
   - `adminNuggetsService.listNuggets()` makes 2 API calls (slow)
   - Stats computation may be slow with large datasets

3. **Missing Features**
   - User status updates will throw errors (expected)
   - Article/Collection status updates will throw errors (expected)
   - Tag management features will throw errors (expected)

- [ ] Check that API calls include Authorization header

#### Test 1.3: Logout Flow
- [ ] Click logout
- [ ] Verify token is removed from localStorage
- [ ] Verify user is redirected to login/home
- [ ] Verify subsequent API calls fail with 401

#### Test 1.4: Token Expiry (if applicable)
- [ ] Wait for token to expire (or manually expire)
- [ ] Make an API call
- [ ] Verify 401 error is handled
- [ ] Verify redirect to login

- [ ] Verify page loads without errors
- [ ] Check that all metric cards display
- [ ] Verify stats load from backend (may take a moment)
- [ ] Check browser console for errors
- [ ] **Expected:** All metrics should show real data (not 0 if data exists)

**Potential Issues:**
- If stats show 0, check backend has data
- If page crashes, check API responses match expected shape
- If slow, check network tab for multiple API calls

#### Test 3.2: Admin Users Page
- [ ] Navigate to `/admin/users`
- [ ] Verify users list loads
- [ ] Check loading state appears then disappears
- [ ] Verify user data displays correctly (name, email, role)
- [ ] Test search functionality
- [ ] Test role filter
- [ ] Click on a user to view details
- [ ] Try to update user role (if admin)
- [ ] Try to delete a user (if admin)
- [ ] **Check console for:** Type errors, undefined properties

**Potential Issues:**
- Users may show as "active" even if backend doesn't track status
- Stats may be 0 (computed client-side, may need optimization)
- Role update may fail if backend doesn't support it

#### Test 3.3: Admin Nuggets Page

- Status update will throw error (expected)

#### Test 3.5: Admin Tags Page
- [ ] Navigate to `/admin/tags`
- [ ] Verify tags list loads
- [ ] Test search functionality
- [ ] Verify tag details (usage count, type, status)
- [ ] Try to delete a tag
- [ ] **Check console for:** Type errors

**Potential Issues:**
- Tag management features will throw errors (expected - not supported by backend)

- [ ] Verify reports list loads
- [ ] Test filter (open, resolved, dismissed)
- [ ] Click on a report to view details
- [ ] Try to resolve a report
- [ ] Try to dismiss a report
- [ ] **Check console for:** Auth errors (if not admin)

**Potential Issues:**
- May require admin role (check backend middleware)

#### Test 3.7: Admin Feedback Page
- [ ] Navigate to `/admin/feedback`
- [ ] Verify feedback list loads
- [ ] Test filter (new, read, archived)
- [ ] Try to update feedback status
- [ ] Try to delete feedback
- [ ] **Check console for:** Anonymous feedback handling

**Potential Issues:**
- Anonymous feedback may not have user object (needs null check)
- Status update should work (backend supports it)

#### Test 3.8: Admin Activity Log Page
- [ ] Navigate to `/admin/activity`
- [ ] Verify page loads
- [ ] **Expected:** Empty list (no backend endpoint)
- [ ] **Check console for:** No errors (should gracefully handle empty state)

---

## CRITICAL ISSUES TO FIX IMMEDIATELY

### ⚠️ High Priority

1. **Auth Token on Admin Endpoints**
   - **Issue:** `/api/moderation/reports` and `/api/feedback` require auth
   - **Risk:** May fail if user not logged in or not admin
   - **Fix:** Ensure admin pages check auth before loading

2. **Error Handling in Services**
   - **Issue:** Services don't have try/catch, errors bubble to pages
   - **Risk:** Unhandled errors may crash pages
   - **Fix:** Add error handling in services or ensure pages handle errors

3. **Performance in AdminNuggetsService**
   - **Issue:** Makes 2 sequential API calls
   - **Risk:** Slow page load
   - **Fix:** Consider parallel calls or backend aggregation endpoint

### ⚠️ Medium Priority

4. **Missing Creator Names in Collections**
   - **Issue:** `mapCollectionToAdminCollection` sets creator.name to ''
   - **Risk:** UI shows empty creator names
   - **Fix:** Fetch user data or add to backend response

5. **User Stats Computation**
   - **Issue:** Stats computed client-side, may be slow/inaccurate
   - **Risk:** Poor performance with large datasets
   - **Fix:** Add backend stats endpoint

---

## QUICK FIXES BEFORE TESTING

### Fix 1: Add Error Handling to Services

**File:** `src/admin/services/adminUsersService.ts`
**Issue:** No try/catch, errors will crash pages
**Fix:** Add try/catch or ensure pages handle errors (pages already have try/catch)

**Status:** ✅ Pages already have error handling

### Fix 2: Handle Auth Errors Gracefully

**File:** `src/admin/services/adminModerationService.ts`
**Issue:** May fail if user not admin
**Fix:** Add .catch() for optional calls

**Status:** ⚠️ Should add .catch() for reports endpoint

### Fix 3: Verify API Response Shapes

**Action:** Check that backend responses match frontend expectations
**Test:** Inspect network tab during testing

---

## TESTING COMMANDS

### Start Backend
```bash
cd server
npm run dev
# Should see: "✓ Connected to MongoDB" and "Server running on port 5000"
```

### Start Frontend
```bash
npm run dev
# Should see: "Local: http://localhost:5173" (or similar)
```

### Check Backend Health
```bash
curl http://localhost:5000/api/health
# Should return: {"status":"ok","timestamp":"..."}
```
