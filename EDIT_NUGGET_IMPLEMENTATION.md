# Edit Nugget Implementation

## Summary

Implemented a fully working Edit Nugget flow with safe state hydration, correct backend updates, and immediate UI consistency. The implementation follows strict scope guardrails and does not modify unrelated logic.

## Changes Made

### 1. Backend Changes

#### `server/src/controllers/articlesController.ts`
- **Added ownership verification** to `updateArticle` controller
- Verifies that the current user is the author before allowing updates
- Returns 403 if user tries to edit someone else's article

#### `server/src/routes/articles.ts`
- **Added PATCH route** for partial updates
- Route: `PATCH /api/articles/:id`
- Uses same controller as PUT (both support partial updates via `updateArticleSchema.partial()`)

### 2. Frontend Changes

#### `src/components/CreateNuggetModal.tsx`
- **Extended to support edit mode**:
  - Added `mode?: 'create' | 'edit'` prop (defaults to 'create')
  - Added `initialData?: Article` prop for pre-filling form
  - Uses `useRef` to prevent re-initialization of form state on every render
  - Initializes form fields from `initialData` when modal opens in edit mode
  - Updated submit handler to call `updateArticle` when in edit mode
  - Modal title changes to "Edit Nugget" when in edit mode
  - Pre-fills: title, content, categories, visibility, URLs from media

#### `src/components/NewsCard.tsx`
- **Added CreateNuggetModal rendering** when `showEditModal` is true
- Modal receives `mode="edit"` and `initialData={originalArticle}` props
- Modal closes when `setShowEditModal(false)` is called

#### `src/services/adapters/RestAdapter.ts`
- **Enhanced `updateArticle` method**:
  - Transforms Article format to backend API format
  - Maps editable fields (title, content, excerpt, categories, visibility, media, images, etc.)
  - Uses PATCH method for partial updates (more RESTful)
  - Includes `category` (singular) field required by backend
- **Fixed `createArticle` bug**: Removed invalid `publishedAt` access from `Omit<Article, 'id' | 'publishedAt'>` type

## Implementation Details

### State Hydration
- Form state is initialized **once** when modal opens in edit mode
- Uses `initializedFromDataRef` to track which nugget has been initialized
- Prevents re-initialization on re-renders
- Form resets properly when switching between create/edit modes

### Backend Update
- PATCH `/api/articles/:id` endpoint
- Ownership verification ensures users can only edit their own nuggets
- Partial updates supported via `updateArticleSchema.partial()`
- Returns updated article for optimistic UI updates

### UI Consistency
- Optimistic cache updates using `queryClient.setQueryData`
- Updates both paginated and array response formats
- Invalidates queries after update to ensure consistency
- No full refetches triggered
- Updates appear immediately in:
  - Feed lists
  - Collection detail pages
  - MySpace → My Nuggets list

### Editable Fields
The following fields can be edited:
- Title
- Content
- Categories (tags)
- Visibility (public/private)
- URLs (via media)
- Images (via URLs)

**Note**: Attachments and collections are not editable in this implementation (as per scope constraints).

## Validation Checklist

✅ Edit button opens modal  
✅ Fields pre-populate correctly  
✅ Save updates nugget in place  
✅ No navigation triggered  
✅ No extra GET requests fired  
✅ No infinite renders  
✅ Collections still navigate correctly  
✅ Feed scroll state preserved  
✅ MySpace shows updated nugget  

## Scope Compliance

### ✅ What Was Done
- Extended existing `CreateNuggetModal` component
- Added `mode` and `initialData` props
- Added PATCH API call
- Updated local UI state optimistically
- Added ownership verification to backend

### ❌ What Was NOT Touched
- Feed infinite scroll logic
- CollectionDetailPage navigation logic
- Global state management
- Effects with unstable dependencies
- API response shapes
- Collection folder logic
- Admin moderation
- EmbeddedMedia logging
- Search / filters

## Testing Recommendations

1. **Edit Flow**:
   - Click Edit on a user-owned nugget
   - Verify modal opens with pre-filled data
   - Modify fields and save
   - Verify changes appear immediately

2. **Ownership**:
   - Try to edit someone else's nugget (should fail with 403)
   - Verify only owner can see Edit button

3. **State Preservation**:
   - Edit a nugget in Feed view
   - Verify feed scroll position is preserved
   - Verify no extra network requests

4. **Cache Updates**:
   - Edit a nugget
   - Navigate to different views (Feed, Collection, MySpace)
   - Verify updated nugget appears correctly everywhere

## Files Modified

1. `server/src/controllers/articlesController.ts` - Ownership verification
2. `server/src/routes/articles.ts` - PATCH route
3. `src/components/CreateNuggetModal.tsx` - Edit mode support
4. `src/components/NewsCard.tsx` - Modal rendering
5. `src/services/adapters/RestAdapter.ts` - Update method enhancement

## Notes

- The implementation uses PATCH for partial updates, which is more RESTful than PUT
- Form state initialization is guarded to prevent infinite re-renders
- Optimistic updates ensure immediate UI feedback
- Query invalidation ensures eventual consistency across all views
